Customizations on oktest

I use oktest often and I always have some last minute overrides. This project is to centralize those.

This branch (expect) represents the changes specific to the expect package. It still uses the underlying 
oktest but starts adding its own flavor. In this way it becomes, even if slowly, different than the oktest.
In time it might remove all dependency to the oktest.
