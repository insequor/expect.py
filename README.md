Customizations on oktest

I use oktest often and I always have some last minute overrides. This project is to centralize those.

I tried to keep the oktest as the main API in this branch but I will create a new branch ("expect") to 
start adding breaking changes to the underlying oktest. In time I might remove all oktest usage if the 
expect api becomes different enough.
